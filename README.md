# RectangleFinder

#### Like Pathfinder, only not

An implementation of a Mars Rover for Next45.

## Guiding principles

- I try to not disinform in the naming. For instance, `setStarting*` methods raise `ValueAlreadyModifiedExceptions` if they are called after initialisation / after the Rover has moved.

## Wild Assumptions

## Other notes

I had some internal debate about the design. In the end I decided to just have the rover control it's own movement, as that allows me to not overthink it, and it's probably closer to how a real world rover would act.
