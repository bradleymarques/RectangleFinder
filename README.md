# RectangleFinder

#### Like Pathfinder, only not

An implementation of a Mars Rover for Next45.

## Guiding principles

- I try to not disinform in the naming. For instance, `setStarting*` methods raise `ValueAlreadyModifiedExceptions` if they are called after initialisation / after the Rover has moved.

## Wild Assumptions

## Getting, building, running, and modifying it

### Prerequisites

### Getting a copy

### Running it

### Modifying it safely
